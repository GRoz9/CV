            <h2>HI!</h2>
            <p>As a 17-year-old student at Canons High School, I am passionate about continually learning and growing my skillset. 
                I am excited to share with you some of the projects I have worked on, including both school assignments and personal endeavours. 
                My love for technology and problem-solving drives me to constantly seek out new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and abilities. 
                <br><br>
                My greatest career aspirations are to not only become a skilled software engineer but also to make a positive impact through my work. 
                I aim to become a reputable team leader, known for my technical expertise and ability to mentor and guide others. 
                My ultimate goal is to use my skills and knowledge to create innovative applications that can improve people's lives and solve real-world problems. 
                I am driven and determined to achieve these objectives and I believe that the future holds great promise for me.

                <p>This is for my NEA coding project for my A-Level Computer science class, which is to create a game using Pygame and innovate it</p>
                <p>
                Developing this game was a valuable learning experience for me, as it helped me improve my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. 
                I learned to manage a complex project by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable sections. 
                This not only made the process easier but also helped me stay on track and meet my tight deadline. 
                I also gained experience in using classes in my code, which improved my ability to reuse code efficiently. 
                This experience has been invaluable in developing my coding skills and preparing me for future projects.

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/GRoz9/SP-To-YT-Playlist-Converter">Spotify to YouTube playlist converter</a></h3>
                <p>
                I've decided to do this project for one reason, which was to share my playlist with my friend which uses YouTube instead of Spotify.
                This allows me to update the YouTube playlist so me and my friend can share our songs together
                </p>
                <p>
                While creating the program, I faced several challenges, one of which was collecting more than 100 songs using an API. 
                Each API call had a limit of 100 songs, and I was initially stumped by this issue as I was new to using APIs. 
                However, after breaking down the problem into smaller parts, I discovered a solution. I used a loop to gather multiple pages of data and concatenate the results to obtain a list of all the songs I needed. 
                This not only solved the problem but also helped me gain a better understanding of breaking down complex issues into smaller, manageable tasks. 
                Overcoming this obstacle gave me great joy and further inspired me to keep learning new concepts.
