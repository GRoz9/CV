        <p>
          As a 17-year-old student at Canons High School, I am passionate about
          continually learning and growing my skillset. I am excited to share
          with you some of the projects I have worked on, including both school
          assignments and personal endeavours. My love for technology and
          problem-solving drives me to constantly seek out new challenges and
          opportunities to expand my knowledge and abilities. <br /><br />
          My greatest career aspirations are to not only become a skilled
          software engineer but also to make a positive impact through my work.
          I aim to become a reputable team leader, known for my technical
          expertise and ability to mentor and guide others. My ultimate goal is
          to use my skills and knowledge to create innovative applications that
          can improve people's lives and solve real-world problems. I am driven
          and determined to achieve these objectives and I believe that the
          future holds great promise for me.

            This is for my NEA coding project for my A-Level Computer science
            class, which is to create a game using Pygame and innovate it
          </p>
          <p>
            Developing this game was a valuable learning experience for me, as
            it helped me improve my critical thinking and problem-solving
            abilities. I learned to manage a complex project by breaking it down
            into smaller, more manageable sections. This not only made the
            process easier but also helped me stay on track and meet my tight
            deadline. I also gained experience in using classes in my code,
            which improved my ability to reuse code efficiently. This experience
            has been invaluable in developing my coding skills and preparing me
            for future projects.

          </h3>
          <p>
            I've decided to do this project for one reason, which was to share
            my playlist with my friend which uses YouTube instead of Spotify.
            This allows me to update the YouTube playlist so me and my friend
            can share our songs together
          </p>
          <p>
            While creating the program, I faced several challenges, one of which
            was collecting more than 100 songs using an API. Each API call had a
            limit of 100 songs, and I was initially stumped by this issue as I
            was new to using APIs. However, after breaking down the problem into
            smaller parts, I discovered a solution. I used a loop to gather
            multiple pages of data and concatenate the results to obtain a list
            of all the songs I needed. This not only solved the problem but also
            helped me gain a better understanding of breaking down complex
            issues into smaller, manageable tasks. Overcoming this obstacle gave
            me great joy and further inspired me to keep learning new concepts.
